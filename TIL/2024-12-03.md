Tip for technical founder:[ Youtube](https://youtu.be/rP7bpYsfa6Q?si=CW6jafVorDUk5I9Q)
**Key Takeaways:**

- **The Technical Founder's Role:** It's more than just "building the app." It requires intense commitment, wearing many hats (from coding to user research), and prioritizing rapid progress over perfect solutions.
- **Ideation Stage:** Focus on building a quick prototype (in days!) to demonstrate your idea to users. Leverage prototyping tools and keep it simple.
- **MVP Stage:** Build a functional MVP to get user commitment (ideally paying customers). Launch quickly (weeks, not months).
- **Launch Stage:** Iterate rapidly based on user feedback and data. Continuously launch new versions and features. Find the balance between building new things and fixing existing ones.

**Key Principles:**

- **Do things that don't scale:** Find clever hacks to get things done quickly in the early days. Manual processes are okay!
- **Create 90/10 solutions:** Focus on the core 90% of functionality that matters most to users. Push off the "nice-to-haves" for later.
- **Choose tech for iteration speed:** Prioritize tools and technologies that allow you to move fast. Don't over-engineer things.
- **Embrace technical debt:** It's okay to have some "messy" code in the early stages. Focus on getting to product-market fit first.
- **Continuously launch:** Don't wait for perfection. Get your product in front of users and iterate based on their feedback.

**Examples:**

Hu uses real-world examples from successful YC companies like Optimizely, Stripe, Doordash, and Segment to illustrate these principles. She shows how these companies prioritized speed and iteration, even if it meant using unconventional methods or accumulating technical debt.

**Overall Message:**

Startups need to move fast. Technical founders should prioritize rapid iteration, user feedback, and getting to product-market fit. Don't get bogged down in perfectionism or over-engineering.

Build a Semantic Layer in a Knowledge Graph:[Youtube](https://youtu.be/FMILiljigeE?si=tDlBhdsFwCTjZ6xY)

- **Why Knowledge Graphs:** Mike emphasizes the importance of knowledge graphs in answering complex questions by connecting data from various sources and creating a holistic view. He highlights the limitations of isolated datasets and the power of connectivity in driving insights.
- **Stardog Platform:** The masterclass focuses on using Stardog Studio, a platform for building and querying knowledge graphs. Mike demonstrates key features like the Explorer for visualizing and navigating the graph, and the Designer for creating data models and rules.
- **Data Modeling:** Mike explains the fundamentals of data modeling in Stardog, including concepts, properties, and relationships. He emphasizes a schema-flexible approach and the importance of starting with a simple model and iterating.
- **Hands-on Exercises:** The majority of the session is dedicated to hands-on exercises where participants follow along with Mike to create a knowledge graph using sample data. He demonstrates how to import data, map it to the data model, and query the graph using the visual Query Builder.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Mike briefly touches on the importance of explainability in AI and how Stardog's knowledge graph can provide insights into the reasoning behind AI models.
- **Q&A:** The session includes interactive Q&A segments where participants ask questions about various aspects of knowledge graphs, data modeling, and the Stardog platform.
